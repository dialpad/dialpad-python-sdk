    """Webhook -- Create

    Creates a new webhook for your company.

    An unique webhook ID will be generated when successfully creating a webhook. A webhook ID is to be required when creating event subscriptions. One webhook ID can be shared between multiple event subscriptions. When triggered, events will be sent to the provided hook_url under webhook. If a secret is provided, the webhook events will be encoded and signed in the JWT format using the shared secret with the HS256 algorithm. The JWT payload should be decoded and the signature verified to ensure that the event came from Dialpad. If no secret is provided, unencoded events will be sent in the JSON format. It is recommended to provide a secret so that you can verify the authenticity of the event.
