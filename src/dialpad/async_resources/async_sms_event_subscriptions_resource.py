    Creates a SMS event subscription. A webhook_id is required so that we know to which url the events shall be sent. A SMS direction is also required in order to limit the direction for which SMS events are sent. Use 'all' to get SMS events for all directions. A target_type and target_id may optionally be provided to scope the events only to SMS to/from that target.

    See https://developers.dialpad.com/docs/sms-events for details on how SMS events work, including the payload structure and payload examples.

    NOTE: **To include the MESSAGE CONTENT in SMS events, your API key needs to have the
    "message_content_export" OAuth scope for when a target is specified in this API and/or
    "message_content_export:all" OAuth scope for when no target is specified.**

    NOTE: See https://developers.dialpad.com/v1.0-archive/reference for APIs that can operate on subscriptions that were created via the deprecated APIs.
