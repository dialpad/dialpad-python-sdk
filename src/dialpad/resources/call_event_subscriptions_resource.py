    Creates a call event subscription. A webhook_id is required so that we know to which url the events shall be sent. Call states can be used to limit the states for which call events are sent. A target_type and target_id may optionally be provided to scope the events only to the calls to/from that target.

    See https://developers.dialpad.com/docs/call-events-logging for details on how call events work,
    including the payload structure, the meaning of different call states, and payload examples.

    Note: **To include the recording url in call events, your API key needs to have the
    "recordings_export" OAuth scope. For Dialpad Meetings call events, your API key needs to have the "conference:all" OAuth scope.**
